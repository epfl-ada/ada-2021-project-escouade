# People's opinion on female representations in popular movies
## Milestone 2



### Abstract 

A study released in 2018 about women on-screen shows that female speaking characters in the top 100 movies accounted for just 31.8 percent of all roles. The controversy surrounding the last Marvel film "Black widow", criticized for its pseudo-feminism, shows that the problem of the representation of women is still relevant today. We wonder why the representation of women has not changed (or a little) for the 10 past years, and if it is due to the opinion people have on this representation. Therefore, the project aims to understand people's opinions about films that represent female characters. To do this, films of interest are selected according to the Bechdel test classifing movies depicting female characters in a non-sexist way. Quotebank will be used to determine people's opinions on the different selected films. A comparison will be made between the opinions about films that represent men and those representing women.


### Research Questions
1. How does the memorability of a movie evolve regarding his characteristics (gender of producer, gender of actors, genre of movies, ratings, etc.) ? 

2. Who are the people talking about cinema, regarding gender and age ?

3. Using Quotebank to define how much about a movie is told (even without seeing it)
    - predict genre
    - predict ratings/reception

### Proposed additional datasets (if any)

Show us that youâ€™ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
