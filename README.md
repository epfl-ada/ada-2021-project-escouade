# How big is the impact of public opinion on the film industry?
## Milestone 2



### Abstract 

For feminist film studies, some of the most recent ground-breaking work has been on recovering women’s film history. Another study released in 2018 about women on-screen shows that female speaking characters in the top 100 movies accounted for just 31.8 percent of all roles. We wonder why the representation of women has not changed (or a little) for the 10 past years, and if it is due to the opinion people have on this representation. The aim of the project is to understand how public opinion impacts the film industry, by automatically analyzing quotations about movies in social and traditional media. The first part of the project deals with the analysis of the relation between public opinion and the general reception a film receives, focusing on gender issues. In the second part, public opinion will be used to predict the different characteristics of a film.


### Research Questions
1. How does the memorability of a movie evolve regarding his characteristics (gender of producer, gender of actors, genre of movies, ratings, etc.) ? 

2. Who are the people talking about cinema, regarding gender and age ?

3. Using Quotebank to define how much about a movie is told (even without seeing it)
    - predict genre
    - predict ratings/reception

### Proposed additional datasets (if any)
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

In addition to Quotebank, which allows the automatic analysis of content in social and traditional media, two other databases will be used for the project :

- Wikidata 
- IMDb
- (Blechdel test)

### Methods
Before response to these questions we need to select relevant elements for each dataset.
For Quotebank dataset, we decide to use the keyword "movies" and "cinema" to extract quotes of interest. Moreover we use also the category "movies" on the URLs.
For Wikidata, we need to extract characteristics of quote's author and movie's actor and producer. The variables of interest are gender, age and professional field. 
Finally, for IMDB dataset, we need movie's ratings, movie's actor and producer.

In order to response to these question some tools need to be use.
