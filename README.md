# People's opinion on female representations in popular movies
## Milestone 2



### Abstract 

A study released in 2018 about women on-screen shows that female speaking characters in the top 100 movies accounted for just 31.8 percent of all roles. The controversy surrounding the last Marvel film "Black widow", criticized for its pseudo-feminism, shows that the problem of the representation of women is still relevant today. We wonder why the representation of women has not changed (or a little) for the 10 past years, and if it is due to the opinion people have on this representation. Therefore, the project aims to understand people's opinions about films that represent female characters. To do this, films of interest are selected according to the Bechdel test classifing movies depicting female characters in a non-sexist way. Quotebank will be used to determine people's opinions on the different selected films. A comparison will be made between the opinions about films that represent men and those representing women.


### Research Questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- Who gives reviews on movies ? 
    - genre/age
    - newspaper
    - professional field (?)
    - occurence of the citation (number of URLs)
    - gender visibility
(Focus on Weinstein scandal ? (2017 or 2018-2019 to limit the dataset))
(Positive or negative and correlate with the IMDb actors/producers/etc on it) 

- Memorability of movies using Quotebank
    - subquestion by gendering 

- Using Quotebank to define how much about a movie is told (even without seeing it)
    - example define genre only by the quotes
    - predict ratings

- Is there a correlation with the review on a movie and the genred figures involved in it ?
- Compare ratings on IMDb with genred figures involved (ex. actors, producer, etc.)
- Evolution across time of the place of women in the industry ?
- Exploit the movie genre

### Proposed additional datasets (if any)
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that youâ€™ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

- Wikidata 
- IMDb
- (Blechdel test)

### Methods
- On the Quotebank Dataset : "movies" NLP or extract the category on the URLs to have the quotes of interest !
- Wikidata : extract characteristics of people (genre, age, professional field, etc)
